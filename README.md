## About
     
This Android application in development will allow the user to track their fastest 400 m sprint times day-to-day. This application serves as a personal exploration into working with the Android API, specifically the GPS location service. The user should open the app, push start, then "go fast"!

In the featured early-development preview picture, the user has just walked 400 m at approximately the average human pace of 1.4 meter/second - a very slow 400 m sprint!
